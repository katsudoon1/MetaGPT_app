## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class and its methods for managing the game flow"),
    ("deck.py", "Contains the Deck class and its methods for shuffling and dealing cards"),
    ("player.py", "Contains the Player class and its methods for managing the player's hand"),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class and its methods for storing and retrieving game data")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "deck.py",
    "player.py",
    "database.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the main logic for managing the game flow, including starting a new game, dealing cards, making player decisions, and calculating the game result.

The 'deck.py' file contains the logic for shuffling the deck of cards and dealing cards to players.

The 'player.py' file contains the logic for managing the player's hand, including adding cards, calculating the hand value, and determining if the hand is a blackjack or bust.

The 'database.py' file contains the logic for storing and retrieving game data, such as the player's balance and win/loss count.

The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the game, where the game instance is created and the game loop is started.

It is important to ensure that all necessary third-party packages are installed and imported before running the game.

The API specification should be followed to implement the required endpoints and handle the corresponding requests and responses.

Make sure to test the game thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected and meets the requirements.
