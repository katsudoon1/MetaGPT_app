## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application"),
    ("models.py", "Contains the User, Game, Chat, and Statistics classes"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views for handling API requests"),
    ("templates/", "Directory for storing HTML templates"),
    ("static/", "Directory for storing static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)"),
    ("urls.py", "Contains the URL routing configuration"),
    ("settings.py", "Contains the application settings"),
    ("requirements.txt", "Contains the required Python packages")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "urls.py",
    "settings.py",
    "requirements.txt"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'models.py' file contains the User, Game, Chat, and Statistics classes that define the data structures and interface definitions for the application.

The 'views.py' file contains the views for handling API requests, such as user registration, login, logout, avatar customization, game start/end, chat message send/get, and statistics retrieval.

The 'urls.py' file contains the URL routing configuration, mapping URLs to the corresponding views.

The 'settings.py' file contains the application settings, such as database configuration, static file paths, and authentication settings.

The 'requirements.txt' file lists the required Python packages for the application.

The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the application, where the Django server is started.

The 'templates/' directory is used for storing HTML templates for rendering dynamic content.

The 'static/' directory is used for storing static files such as CSS and JavaScript.

Make sure to initialize the required Python packages by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt' before starting the application.
